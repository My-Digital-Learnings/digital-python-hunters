# Python Training for JAVA Developer  Resume
[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/eddiewebb/hugo-resume/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/eddiewebb/hugo-resume/tree/master)

Created from [Start Bootstrap - Resume](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/resume/).

This is basically a single-page website with auto-scrolling based on left-hand nav.  Dedicated project/publications pages allow more detail.  Includes a client-side search powered by fuse.js at '/search' but currently theme does not link to that anywhere.  Includes an `/admin` endpoint that can allow authorized users to use a WYSIWYG editor and commit files back to markdown, but with a Wordpress/CMS like experience.
